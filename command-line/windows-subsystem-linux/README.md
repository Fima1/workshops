# The Windows Subsystem for Linux
Traditionally, Windows has been viewed as an inferior operating system for developers due to its lack of crucial tools available on Linux or Linux-like systems such as MacOS. Windows equivalents either wouldn't exist or be woefully under-supported and sometimes feature-incomplete next to their Linux counterparts. So, what's a Windows user to do if they want to get hacking?

For years, the default answer was simply to install Linux... or get a Mac. Neither of which were good solutions! Like it or not, Linux can be a hassle, and it's not always the best experience for complete beginners. And a new (expensive) computer is just not feasible in most cases.

Enter the Windows Subsystem for Linux, often abbreviated as "WSL."

Put simply, WSL allows you to run full-blown Linux distributions inside Windows, as if they were just another app like your browser or text editor. This is a _fantastic_ ability, allowing people to start using Linux's rich dev tools with much less hassle than before.
